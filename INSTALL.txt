Install

Just do the usual:

        python setup.py install

You'll probably run into dependency issues. You'll want to install pip and then
run this to install all dependencies:

        pip install --requirement=DEPENDENCIES.txt

Pip may run into problems installing numpy and netCDF4 in sequence. You should
first install numpy

        pip install numpy

and try again.
