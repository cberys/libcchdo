=======
Install
=======

Just do the usual:

        python setup.py install

Dependencies
============

External libraries you should install before trying to install python module
dependencies:

 * MySQL - for database access
 * netCDF4 - (optional) for netCDF file manipulation
   * HDF5 - library needed by netCDF 4 to write files

You'll want to install pip (a package manager for Python).

Dependency tree
---------------

All nodes are python packages except those marked external.

 * libcchdo
   * sqlalchemy
     * MySQL-python
       * MySQL (external)
   * netCDF4
     * numpy
     * netCDF 4 (external)
       * HDF5 (external)

Notes about order
-----------------

Pip runs into problems installing numpy and netCDF4 in sequence. You should
first install numpy

        pip install numpy

And then run this to install all dependencies:

        pip install --requirement=DEPENDENCIES.txt
