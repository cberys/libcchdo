=======
Install
=======

First work through the dependencies and then do the usual::

    python setup.py install

Dependencies
============

Dependencies are listed in DEPENDENCIES.txt but don't worry about them. Read
this first to find out whether you need all of them.

Dependency tree
---------------

All nodes are python packages except those marked as libraries.

* libcchdo
  * SQLAlchemy
    * MySQL-python (optional)
      * MySQL (library)
  * netCDF4 (optional)
    * numpy
    * netCDF 4 (library)
      * HDF5 (library, needed to write netCDF 4 files)

External Libraries
------------------

* MySQL - (optional) if you have downloaded a cached database
* netCDF4 - (optional) for netCDF file manipulation
  * HDF5 - library needed by netCDF 4 to write files

Python packages
---------------

You'll want to install pip (a package manager for Python) to make installation
easier. If you do not want any optional packages you can simply install
sqlalchemy::

    pip install SQLAlchemy

Note about order
----------------

Pip runs into problems installing numpy and netCDF4 in one go. You should
first install numpy

    pip install numpy

and then use pip to install all dependencies

    pip install --requirement=DEPENDENCIES.txt
