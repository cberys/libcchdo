Install
=======

::

    pip install numpy && pip install .

It is of note that numpy must be installed before the rest of the packages.
Some required packages will not install concurrently with numpy.

Dependencies
============

Dependencies are listed in setup.py. Don't worry about them. Read this first to
find out whether you need all of them.

Dependency tree
---------------

All nodes are python packages except those marked as libraries.

* libcchdo
  - geoalchemy

    + SQLAlchemy
    + MySQL-python (optional if you have downloaded a cached database)

      * MySQL (library)

  - netCDF4 (optional) for netCDF file manipulation

    + numpy
    + netCDF >=3.0 (library)

      * HDF5 (library, needed to write netCDF 4 files)

  - cdecimal (optional but highly recommended) provides a HUGE speed boost
  - coverage (optional) only needed for test coverage
  - lxml (optional) used to generate HTML for csv_view

    + lxml (library)

  - docutils (optional) used to check ReStructuredText format.
  - oauth2 (optional) used for downloading Bitbucket wiki content
  - paramiko (optional) used for data directory manipulation
  - scipy (optional) needed for interpolation and scientific math
  - PIL (optional) needed for image processing plot thumbnails
  - matplotlib (optional) needed for plotting
  - basemap (optional) needed for plotting maps
  - pandas (optional) needed for merging

External Libraries

You need to install these yourself based on your operating system.

* MySQL
* netCDF4

  - HDF5 - library needed by netCDF 4 to write files

* libgeos

Using pip
=========

You'll want to install pip (package manager for Python).

Developing
----------

When developing, you want to be able to edit and run code without reinstalling.
`pip` will allow you to do this by installing the package as editable::

    pip install --editable .

or

::

    pip install -e .

Deploying
---------

If you do not want any optional packages you can simply run pip install::

    pip install .

If you do want extras, you can find them under `extras_require`. Only 
`pip>=1.2.0` understands this command.

::

    # Install all extras
    pip install .[all]
    # Install only extras that are specified
    pip install .[speed,netcdf,plot,merge]
