=======
Install
=======

Two steps!

1. pip install --requirement=DEPENDENCIES.txt && \
   pip install --requirement=DEPENDENCIES-optional.txt

    NOTE: Not all dependencies are required! See below.

2. python setup.py install

Dependencies
============

Dependencies are listed in DEPENDENCIES.txt and DEPENDENCIES-optional.txt but
don't worry about them. Read this first to find out whether you need all of
them.

Dependency tree
---------------

All nodes are python packages except those marked as libraries.

* libcchdo
  - geoalchemy
    + SQLAlchemy
    + MySQL-python (optional if you have downloaded a cached database)
      * MySQL (library)
  - netCDF4 (optional) for netCDF file manipulation
    + numpy
    + netCDF >=3.0 (library)
      * HDF5 (library, needed to write netCDF 4 files)
  - cdecimal (optional but highly recommended) provides a HUGE speed boost
  - coverage (optional) only needed for test coverage
  - scipy (optional) needed for interpolation and scientific math
  - matplotlib (optional) needed for plotting
  - basemap (optional) needed for plotting maps

External Libraries
------------------

You need to install these yourself based on your operating system.

* MySQL
* netCDF4
  - HDF5 - library needed by netCDF 4 to write files

Python packages
---------------

You'll want to install pip (a package manager for Python).

If you do not want any optional packages you can simply install geoalchemy::

    pip install geoalchemy

If you want everything::

    pip install --requirement=DEPENDENCIES.txt
    pip install --requirement=DEPENDENCIES-optional.txt

Note about order
----------------

Pip runs into problems installing numpy and netCDF4 in one go. You should
install numpy first and then netCDF4.
