-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Description
libcchdo provides a format-less data model for the CCHDO and a centralized 
place to put ways to read and write from it. Said format-less data model is
based on DataFiles which have Columns that are associated with Parameters. From
the data model, the user may write out to a database model of the data or read
in more data and mash it together or write it out in a different format. When 
it is said the data is format-less, it is actually in a neutral format that 
lets it be manipulated easily into other formats.

- Testing
Just run

rake test

and see what happens! Test batteries should be written at least for every 
class. Every file under test/ will be run as a ruby test battery.
